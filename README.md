# Horse-Racing-Prediction
This work focuses on the prediction of Hong Kong Jockey Club (HKJC) horse racing results using Deep Learning Neural Networks. We decide to collect a large dataset from the ofﬁcial HKJC website and provide a tool to directly download the most current data. Furthermore, we tackle the problem of using various deep learning architectures, including a simple MLP regression method, a CNN to account for spatial relationships, as well as an RNN to model temporal dependencies along with sequential historical data. The results of ”win” and ”place” accuracy are shown for all the different architectures that have been tested and implemented.
